Its aims are to deliver sensitive and effective care that meets the cultural needs of individuals, families, and groups, and to integrate transcultural concepts into nursing education, research, and clinical practice. Madeleine Leininger described it as based on comparative research of cultures, aiming for cultural universalism and independence in nursing care and examining differences across cultures in health, illness, care, beliefs, and values, all done respectfully.", "timestamp": "2025-08-26T14:49:47.799936"}, {"user": "what is blood pressure?", "assistant": "Blood pressure is the force of circulating blood against the walls of the arteries. It is expressed as two numbers: systolic pressure over diastolic pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). \n\n- Systolic pressure (top number) is the pressure when the heart contracts (beats).\n- Diastolic pressure (bottom number) is the pressure when the heart relaxes between beats.\n\nExample: 120/80 mmHg. Normal values vary with age and individual factors, and blood pressure can be measured with a cuff (sphygmomanometer) or automated devices.", "timestamp": "2025-08-26T14:50:02.824338"}, {"user": "what is the noraml hp level in human body?", "assistant": "It seems you meant blood pressure (BP).

Blood pressure can vary with age, activity, time of day, and measurement conditions.
