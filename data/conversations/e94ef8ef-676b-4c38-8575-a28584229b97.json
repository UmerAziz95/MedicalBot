[{"user": "what is transcultural nursing", "assistant": "Transcultural nursing is a field of nursing focused on providing culturally sensitive and competent care to individuals, families, and groups from diverse cultural backgrounds. It involves understanding and integrating patients\u2019 beliefs, values, practices, and social contexts into care, with the goal of meeting their cultural needs and delivering culturally congruent care. It emphasizes education, research, and clinical practice to incorporate transcultural concepts, and positions the nurse (often guided by Leininger\u2019s model) as central to recognizing that health meanings vary across cultures.", "timestamp": "2025-08-28T13:22:14.283512"}]
